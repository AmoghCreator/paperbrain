<h1> Problem Statement </h1>

<p> People publish a lot of fascinating research out to the world, yet the tools to consume this research are quite primitive. It is also really hard to understand the research papers. </p>

<h1> Idea </h1>
  
<p> Our platform is the go-to platform for accessing and understanding research papers. We provide a fascinating interface for users to search for papers and return a list of papers with their abstracts and a direct pdf link in a prettified format.

Since research papers are generally difficult to understand, we have added a explain paper feature using Open AI's GPT-3 model. Users can simply copy-paste an excerpt and our primed model will translate it into an easy and understandable form.

We also have a bookmark feature that we can use to bookmark the paper we like and access it later. 
We have a markdown feature as well, we enable users to take notes while going through papers simultaneously, and they can access them later as well. 
So this can be a holistic platform for all the researchers or anyone who reads research papers.. </p>
